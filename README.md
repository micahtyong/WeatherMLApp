## Weather / Outfit Recommender Application ##

<img src = "demo/Over.png" width = "500">

Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and Brain.js to recommend an outfit type to the user. 

## Motivation ##

The motive behind this web app was to take a well known, data-driven idea, then rebuild and maintain it from the ground up in order to learn the fundamentals behind designing and programming a React Web Application. I also wanted to apply the skills and tools that I learned from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course to this project; hence, the birth of the underdeveloped outfit recommender. 

## Build Status ##

This project is mainly for proof-of-concept. The fetching of weather API data and error handling runs beautifully. The outfit recommender system mainly lacks data as examples must be manually labelled so only a couple were used. Even so, however, the predictor is quite powerful and performs relatively well. Techniques such as feature scaling, mean normalization, and neural networks were used to train and fit the data.
